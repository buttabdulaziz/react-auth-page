# 🔐 React Auth Page 
This project is a simple authentication system built using **React**. It includes **Login** and **Signup** functionality with backend **API integration**.

The website is built using **React**, **Bootstrap**, and **CSS**.
For live weather updates, I used Free Weather APIs (only current weather and a few available details). The rest of the content is hardcoded for design and learning purposes.
